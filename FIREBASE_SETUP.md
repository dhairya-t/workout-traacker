# Firebase Setup Guide - Free Cloud Sync 🔥

## 1. Create Firebase Project (FREE)

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Click "Create a project"
3. Name it: `workout-tracker` (or whatever you like)
4. Disable Google Analytics (not needed)
5. Click "Create project"

## 2. Enable Firestore Database

1. In your Firebase project, click "Firestore Database"
2. Click "Create database"
3. Choose "Start in production mode"
4. Pick your location (closest to you)
5. Click "Done"

## 3. Get Your Config

1. Click the ⚙️ gear icon → "Project settings"
2. Scroll down to "Your apps"
3. Click the `</>` icon to add a web app
4. Register app name: `workout-tracker`
5. Copy the `firebaseConfig` values

## 4. Create Your .env File (SECURE)

Create a `.env` file in your project root and add your Firebase values:

```bash
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-actual-project-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-actual-sender-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-actual-app-id
```

**⚠️ Important:** 
- Replace `your-actual-*` with real values from Firebase
- This file is already in `.gitignore` - it won't be committed to GitHub
- Keep this file secure and never share it publicly

## 5. Set Firestore Rules (Important!)

In Firebase Console → Firestore Database → Rules, replace with:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow read/write to all documents (since it's just you)
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

Click "Publish"
